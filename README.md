# Overview

In this project, a teammate and I built a desk order application to speed up the process of orders depending on the different scenarios we could have

# Development Environment

We used Visual Studio as our code editor, C# as the programming language, and Windows Forms
We also used a document-type database using a JSON file

# Useful Websites

- [Windows Forms](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/winforms/overview/?view=netdesktop-7.0)
- [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)

# Future Work

- We will change the database type (JSON) to an actual MongoDB document database to store all of our orders information
- We will change the Windows Forms to build the project using ASP.NET and Razor
